PratiqueJava1Z0803
==================

Practice Java is an Android app that hopes to help programmers pass the Oracle´s 1Z0-803 test to become 
an Oracle Certified Associate Java SE7 Programmer. 

Until now, this is a non-glitter/non-frills app that contains a list of 100+ real exam questions 
touching every topic of the exam.

I´m opening the code up, since there is evident space for improvements.

These are some of the areas in which I think this app can be improved:

1) Exam simulation with time tracking and scores;

2) Better UI;

3) Better way to store questions, perhaps using SQLite. Currently, each question is a class of it´s own.

4) More questions and content.
